# Discord Bot Repository

Welcome to the repository of my Discord bot, written in TypeScript using the Discord JS library. This bot is based on DiscordJS v14 and provides a convenient command handler with slash commands. If you're looking to develop your own bot, you're in luck - this template is perfect for that!

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a file with the extension .env in the main folder of your bot and add your token to it. For example: `token = YourToken`
3. Install the required packages by running `yarn add`.
4. Start the bot in debug mode using `yarn start:dev`.
5. Before starting the bot, you need to compile it. To do this, use the `yarn build` command in the terminal. After successful compilation, start the bot with the `yarn start` command
